# Tsuku

This is a simple cli tool made in python, 
its whole purpose is to be able to write and save a minimal list.

This project is developed on mac for mac, for bash and zsh,
since those are the terminals i use and the platform i use daily.


If anyone is intrested, i highly advise configuring it to your liking.

Commands:



`l` lists all the tasks

`c name` c is for create, name is the name of the task

`r ` r is for remove, asks for input, taking index or name of item


Download:

For now you gotta download the .py and data.txt,
put them into the same dir since the .py writes and reads from the txt file.
