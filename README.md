# Tsuku

This is a simple cli tool made in python, 
its whole purpose is to be able to write and save a minimal list.

This project is developed on mac for mac, for bash and zsh,
since those are the terminals i use and the platform i use daily.


If anyone is intrested, i highly advise configuring it to your liking.

Commands:

`t` is the base command,

`t l` lists all the tasks

`t c name` c is for create, name is the name of the task

`t r name/index` r is for remove, using either the name or the index that is show in the list


Download:

For now you gotta download the .py and data.txt,
put them into the same dir since the .py writes and reads from the txt file.
