# Tsuku

This is a simple cli tool made in python, 
its whole purpose is to be able to write and save a minimal list.

This project is developed on mac for mac, for bash and zsh,
since those are the terminals i use and the platform i use daily.


If anyone is intrested, i highly advise configuring it to your liking.

Commands:



`l` lists all the tasks

`c` is for create, example `c newitem` 

`r` is for remove, asks for input, 
prints curr list and asks for either index or item name to delete it and shows new list


Download:

For now you gotta download the .py and data.txt,
put them into the same dir since the .py writes and reads from the txt file.
